👾 Hey, I’m Krishna – a Full-Stack Developer in the Making!
🎓 From BCom to Coding: Yep, I traded financial statements for JavaScript functions. Now, I’m all about turning ideas into interactive web experiences.

🌐 Building the Web, One Line at a Time:
I’ve completed the 2024 Web Development Bootcamp, cranking out 50+ projects in the process! From React.js to Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, I’m all about pushing pixels and making backends behave. Currently, I’m working on a major project that’s about to drop—stay tuned!

🔧 Let’s Code Magic Together:
I’m passionate about collaboration, whether it’s solving complex problems or building something from scratch. Always down to connect with like-minded developers to create something unforgettable.

💡 Current Focus:
Leveling up my skills, especially with Next.js and building dynamic full-stack apps. Also, obsessed with making interfaces as smooth as my morning coffee.

📩 Hit Me Up:
Whether it’s to talk code, brainstorm ideas, or even chat about the best camera gear (spoiler: I’m also into photography!), feel free to reach out at [radhakrishnanr2699@gmail.com]. I’m always excited to connect with other devs and creators.

🎯 Fun Fact:
When I’m not coding, I’m usually out capturing moments with my camera, from cityscapes to the great outdoors—because who doesn’t love a good sunset shot?
